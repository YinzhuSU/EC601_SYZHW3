1. How does a program read the cvMat object, in particular, what is the
order of the pixel structure?

A matrix in cvMat contents several digits, and single channel means each member in the 
matrix contents only one digit. But when we use cvMat to express a multiple-colors-picture, the matrix can be known as a triplets, which means each member in the matrix contents three digits, R, G and B.
For example, when we create a 2-D matrix, we can use this prototype:
cvMat* cvCreateMat ( int rows, int cols, int type );
and when we define a type, we use this prototype:
CV <bit depth>(S|U|F) C<number of channels>.
